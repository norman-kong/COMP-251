# COMP-251

This repository contains my assignments for the course COMP 251 (Algorithms and Data Structures) at McGill University (W2021).

A1: 
- Exercise 1: Building a hash table implemented using the following methods:
  - multiplication: $h(k) = ( (A \cdot k) \mod 2^w) >> (w-r)$
  - linear probing: $g(k,i) = *h(k) + i) \mod 2^r$
- Exercise 2: Application of hashmaps to a "real-world problem" (a fictional problem in a real-world setting). 

A2:
- Exercise 1: Using Complete Search methods to create an algorithm for a sudoku variant. 
- Exercise 2: Application of dynamic programming to a "real-world problem" for a game where students collect points based off their position in a line. 
- Exercise 3: Applying greedy algorithms to a "real-world problem" for homework scheduling.

A3:
- Exercise 1: Programmed a graph algorithm to compute the minumum number of moves to cross a grid. 
- Exercise 2: Using graph algorithms to model vaccine distribution during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Exercise 3: Implemented the Ford-Fulkerson graph algorithm to calculate the maximum flow of a directed weighted graph. 

Assignment PDFs cannot be publicly posted online but details can be discussed privately.
